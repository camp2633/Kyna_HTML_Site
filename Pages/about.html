  <h1>About the Artist</h1>
  <p>I am Kyna EM Levi, an artist, educator, and innovator.</p>

  <p>I use found objects and transform them into cosmic creations with the use of Hebrew calligraphy and text.</p>

  <p>I believe in the value of repurposing items. I do what I do because I am a spiritual being who believes in environmental values and turning the profane into something sacred by illuminating the natural beauty in things that the naked eye might not see.</p>
